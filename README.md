# CoderDojoSaar-Turtle

This is a little tutorial for the programming club [CoderDojo Saar](https://coderdojo-saar.de). The python library [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) will be introduced as well as simple language constructs like methods, for-loops, lists and recursion.
Those will be shown in little examples and practised with excercises. 

The project is right now under construction and the full documentation will be added here later.
