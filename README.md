# CoderDojoSaar-Turtle

This is a course for the programming club [CoderDojo Saar](https://coderdojo-saar.de). The python library [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) will be introduced as well as simple language constructs like methods, for-loops, lists and advanced ones like recursion.
Those will be shown in small examples and practiced with interesting excercises. 

The `main` branch contains the exercise sheets as a pdf and LaTeX file as well as the cheat sheet. The repro has two other branches: the `results` branch contains the finial solutions for all the exercises from the sheet and the `tasks` branch has the bare bone python files for the tasks to solve.

The project is right now under construction and the full documentation will be added here later.
