# CoderDojoSaar-Turtle

This is a course for the programming club [CoderDojo Saar](https://coderdojo-saar.de). The python library [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) will be introduced as well as simple language constructs like methods, for-loops, lists and advanced ones like recursion.
Those will be shown in small examples and practiced with interesting excercises. 

The project is right now under construction and the full documentation will be added here later.
